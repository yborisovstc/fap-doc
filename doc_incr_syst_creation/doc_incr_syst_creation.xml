    <sect1 id="sec_intro"><title>Introduction</title>
	<simpara>Main idea of incremental mutation is that it allows creating the model step by step via small
	    changes (mutations). On each step the creator makes the small change into the current state of the model.
	    It is simple to ensure that the change is safe. This is because the current state of the model is verified and
	    the change itself can be verified also. So such approach allows to create the model via one phase, comparing
	    to approach where at lease two phases are required: 1 - creating the model description, 2 - creating the 
	    model by the description, running the model and verifying it.
	    <footnote><simpara>This doesn't mean that the mutation cannot breake the model anyway. For instance the mutation
		    of delaying node referenced by another node will cause the model inconsistency. The statement was that 
		    the mutation is controlled and can be rolled back if being not accepted.</simpara></footnote>
	</simpara>
	<simpara>Comparing incremantal mutation approach and arbitrary mutation approach we can see that for the first 
	    approach the subject of change is the model itself,  while for the second option the subject is the model 
	    description. To be more specific even the incremental mutation approach has the model description as the 
	    subject, but the change of the description is elementary - just adding one record.</simpara>
	<simpara>The mutation in case of IM can be specified basing on the current model status, i.e. directly operating to
	    the model.</simpara>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="sec_base"><title>Basis</title>
	<sect2 id="sec_base_deptypes"><title>Types of dependencies in mutations</title>
	    <simpara>Mutation depends one on another. This dependency is created by pair of relation via model. 
		Let's  consider mutations Ma and Mb. Both mutations 
		relates to the same node N in model, the realtion can be designated as (Ma,N) and (Mb,N). 
		These relations in turn create transitivelly realtion (Ma, Mb). The
		two types of relation can be distinquished: mutation to be applied to node, and node to already 
		applied mutation. These types of realtions can be designated as Ri (initiated) and
		Ra (applied mutation).</simpara>
	    <simpara>There can be the following kinds of relations (dependencies) of applied mutaions:</simpara>
	    <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>Parent. This relations are of node creation mutation and pointed to the node that is to 
		    be parent of node being created</listitem>
		<listitem>Object. This type references pointed to the nodes that are to be mutated.</listitem>
		<listitem>References. This type references are used in content change mutation, where the content 
		    is pointing to some node.</listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	    <simpara>The Ri relations also can be classified as:</simpara>
	    <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>Creation - mutation creates node</listitem>
		<listitem>Addition - mutation adds sub-nodes to node</listitem>
		<listitem>Removement - mutation removes node</listitem>
		<listitem>Renaming - mutation renames node</listitem>
		<listitem>Change - mutation change content of node</listitem>

    <sect1 id="sec_principles"><title>Basic principles</title>
	<sect2 id="sec_principles_incr"><title>Incrementation - Chromosome can be changed only by appending mutation</title>
	    <simpara>Refrasing the principle is "it is not allowed to change the past". The currents chromo is the "documented" 
		history of system creation, so its change is not allowed.</simpara>
	    <simpara>This means that any mutation in the chromosome cannot be changed, moved or removed. 
		So any mutation just grows chromosome but not destroys.  </simpara>
	</sect2>
	<sect2><title>Chromosome as subject and system as object of creation</title>
	    <simpara>Chromosome is the instruction of how to change the system. So system here is object of changed whereas 
		chromosome plus creator acts as subject.</simpara>
	    <simpara>This means that the references in chromo (to object node, to parent etc.) are the references within system 
		but not within chromo itserf.</simpara>
	</sect2>
	<sect2><title>Mutations references of types other than -parent- can point only to onwned node</title>
	    <simpara>The references are limited by owner context. Only parent-child relations can be global.</simpara>
	</sect2>
	<sect2><title>Reverse creation chromo from system.</title>
	    <simpara>There shall be allowed to create chromo from run-time system model as reverse process. 
		This reverse process melt all the mutation applied to the system and creates purified chromo. </simpara>
	</sect2>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="sec_lim"><title>Limitations</title>
	<sect2><title>A mutation of node that has dependencies can only be applied after the dependency with greatest rank</title>
	    <simpara>Node dependencies are mutations and this mutation owning chromo node. The dependencies are defined as :</simpara>
	    <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>Mutation referred to the node</listitem>
		<listitem>Mutation referred to components of the node.</listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	</sect2>
	<sect2 id="sec_lim_transp"><title>Transposition of nodes within chromo is not allowed</title>
	    <simpara>This is not allowed because of contradiction to principle <xref linkend="sec_principles_incr"/>. 
		Any transposition will change the current chromo that is disabled by the principle.</simpara>
	    <simpara>In some earlier implementation of incremental mutaion scheme the transposition of two modes was used 
		to fix the mistake of creator forgotten adding fundamental nodes at the beginning of chromosome. 
		In this case the system is just failed - the creation cannot be continued.  The example of this case is as: 
		creator creates nodes N_A and N_B in root node N_R and mutated them with the series of mutation, creating internal nodes
		for instance. Then the user is going to add into N_A and N_B some more nodes that inherit parent from external module. 
		But now the creator realizes that he forgot include the module into root node N_R. The solution now is to include the 
		module to node N_A and then creates the new childs to N_A and N_B.
		But obviously this makes the structure of the system a bit messy. More nice solution would be to have the module in 
		beginning of root node and then use its nodes as parents in equitable manner from other parts of system.</simpara>
	    <simpara>What would be the solution here to fix this kinds of creator mistakes? One of the solution is to use "templates" 
		for creation of system. Such templates should to have the first nodes dedicated for fundamental and important parents. 
		Another way is to leave the mistaken system and creates new one. The creator
		can use "moving" nodes from old system to new in order to reuse the old system structure.</simpara>

    <sect1 id="sec_rollback"><title>Rollback of mutations</title>
	<sect2><title>Introduction</title>>
	    <simpara>Undo of changes made is important mechanism of system creation. 
		It allowes to refuse the part of creation that is realized as incorrect and "return" to 
		the point of creation from what the correct creation can be continued.</simpara>
	    <simpara>But what could be "part" of creation? As it was seen, in hierarchical system the component 
		of system (e.g. node) is self-dependent sub-system. So the creator
		may wish to rollback the mutation only for local sub-system. On the other hand there is the sequence of 
		mutation ordered nativelly, i.e. by the time of applying.</simpara>

    <sect1><title>Use-cases</title>
	<sect2><title>New node created from parent that was mutated via outer mutation - the outer mutation doesn't not get to the child</title>
	    <simpara>Node N_A in owner node N_O is mutated by outer mutation M_1. Using outer mutation can be caused by existing some dependencies to node N_A that
		makes local mutaion unsafe (i.e. causing to system inconsistency). Then new mutation of N_O are applied for creating node N_B as the child of 
		node N_B. The mutation M_1 will not get to the child N_B because chromosome of N_B doesn't containg M_1. So we can say that M_1 doesn't affect N_B genotype but
		phenotype only.</simpara>

    <sect1 id="sec_disc"><title>Discussion</title>
	<simpara>We have introduced Discrete Event System modelling solution basing on using of multiagent approach. Layer based
	    architecture was proposed as the structural base of the solution. Main principles of building the parts of layers were 
	    also clarified.</simpara>
	<simpara>We outline the implementation of the layers and show the possibility of covering full functionality of layers by
	    using the approach. Some exampes were introduced to clarify the particular use cases when creating the models.</simpara>
	<simpara>We shown that the proposed approach provides the unified language and maens of creating both the structure of DES 
	    and transition functions. So it was proven therefore that using the proposed approach allows to create 
	    the models of wide range of complexity.</simpara>
